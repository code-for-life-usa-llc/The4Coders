            <br>
            <div id="Pea">
            <p id="phone" class="Mango">A large body of research, most of which is ecological, has investigated the relationship <br> between job loss or unemployment rates and mental health, substance use, and suicide.</p>

            <h3 class="Mango" id="fish">The Physical Heatlh Problems</h3>
            <br>
            <div id="Peanut">
            <p id="Food" class="Mango">From a prospective study of the impact of stress on health in 300 men assessed every six months, <br> men who became unemployed after entering the study were compared with an equal number, matched for age and race, who continued to work.<br> Psychological and health data after unemployment were compared between the two groups by multivariate analysis of variance and covariance.<br> After unemployment, symptoms of somatization, depression, and anxiety were significantly greater in the unemployed than employed. <br> Large standard deviations on self-esteem scores in the unemployed group suggested that some men coped better than others with job-loss stress.</p>

            <br>
            <div id="Peanuts">
            <p id="BlackBerry" class="Mango">Employed people who are actively hunting for a job get more than half of the job offers on the table, <br> versus unemployed workers who receive only 16% of job offers. <br>What’s more, the offers were better for employed people.</p>

            <h3 class="Mango" id="BlueFish">Inflation</h3>
            <br>
            <div id="Butter">
            <p id="IPhone" class="Mango">Inflation can make it harder for companies to offer salary increases at all. <br> Just as rising inflation leads to higher costs for a consumer or worker, it also means increased costs for a business.<br> This can have a negative impact on bottom line results – whether due to a drop in revenue or an increase in expenses - <br> and therefore may have less money to put towards salary budgets for the year ahead.</p>
